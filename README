This is a collection of scripts and shell functions I find useful.
I use zsh, so all functions are only tested with zsh. Maybe you're lucky and they work with bash, too. I don't know.

Hereby, I publish my own work on this collection under a two-clause BSD license (see LICENSE), work of others are of course covered by the licenses their original authors chose.

If you have any suggestions, feel free to contact me at thinkscripts@4z2.de
