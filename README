This is a collection of scripts and shell functions I find useful.
I use zsh, so all functions are only tested with zsh. Maybe you're lucky and
they work with bash, too. I don't know.

Hereby, I publish my own work on this collection under a two-clause BSD license
(see LICENSE), for works of others check license notes in the file itself to
see which license the original author chose.

If you have any suggestions, feel free to contact me at thinkscripts@4z2.de
